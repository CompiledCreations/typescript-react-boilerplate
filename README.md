# Motivation

I've been using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for projects. They are great when you need to get started on something quickly however there simplicity means I'm often bumping up against their limitations.

This boilerplate is an attempt to provide something relatively simple that can be used to start a basic project quickly while being easy to customise.
